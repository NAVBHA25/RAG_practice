Key Components
Loading and spliting csv files.
Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings
Retriever setup for querying the processed documents
Creating a question and answer over the csv data.
Method Details
Document Preprocessing
The csv is loaded using langchain Csvloader
The data is split into chunks.
Vector Store Creation
OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.
A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.
Retriever Setup
A retriever is configured to fetch the most relevant chunks for a given query.
Benefits of this Approach
Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.
Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.
Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.
Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.
